# T2PFS-FWZICbIP-DLbU
This MCDM approach uses type-2 Pythagorean fuzzy sets incorporated with FWZICbIP for criteria weighting. Then, the Dynamic Localisation-based Utility (DLbU) is used for alternatives' ranking.  This code is a numerical simulation for the methodology presented in the research article with DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2024.109671.
